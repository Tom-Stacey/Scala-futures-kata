# Scala Futures

This is an example Scala application to play with Futures. To compile and run tests, just run:
```sh
$ sbt test
```
from the repo's root directory.

The aim is to get all the tests to pass. The tests would usually involve mocking the connectors, but in this instance you should write code in the services that calls the connectors and uses their functions.
